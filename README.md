## Chetan Sanghani

I am a determined individual who is quick to learn and dedicated about doing so.

My strong foundation in programming and Git leaves me in a position to learn a new language at the tip of a hat, in 3 months I learned Ruby and JS to a functioning level, I did this with a solid and disciplined regime of 8 hours immersion at work and 2 hours of study after work every day.

## Skills

### Overview

- I have achieved an Access to higher education foundation degree in Biological and Biomedical Sciences.
